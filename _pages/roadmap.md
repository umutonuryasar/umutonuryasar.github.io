### Vision Statement

My objective is to achieve **Doctoral-level expertise** in specialized Artificial Intelligence domains, leveraging my **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** foundation. The focus is on **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, applied to complex dynamic and spatial systems. My progress will be measured through production-grade projects and peer-reviewed quality technical deep dives.
