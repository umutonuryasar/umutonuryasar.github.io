## Bridging EEE and AI: Machine Learning for Physical Systems

Welcome. I am a **Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong background in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering**, focused on creating intelligent solutions that interact directly with the physical world. My core competencies are built upon advanced coursework in **Deep Learning**, specializing in the two critical pillars of autonomy:

* **Perception:** Designing and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks for advanced image processing, object recognition, and environmental sensing.
* **Decision-Making:** Applying Reinforcement Learning algorithms to optimize control policies, solve sequential decision problems, and develop intelligent agents for robotics and complex dynamic systems.

My engineering background uniquely enables me to handle both the algorithm design (software) and the **hardware integration and real-time performance optimization**.
